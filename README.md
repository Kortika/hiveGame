# Hive Game
(Done as a project for the course " Programmeren II " academic year 2015-2016 for Bachelor of Informatica in UGent.)

The game consist of hive pieces which are insects with unique moves without a standard board like other board games.
The goal of the game is to surround the opponent's queen with pieces.
It can either be yours or the opponent's pieces as long as the queen gets surrounded.
